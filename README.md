This script works with Google Appscript. This script is made for a use case like having to automate dynamic values in datastudio via a google sheet.

## Getting Started

In appscript you can simply copy/past the code into your appscript ide.

### Automate System

You'll need to create a new trigger `Go to edit > current project's trigger and here click on create a new trigger` then you will be able to choose TimeDriven and set your setup of automatization.

### Setup

You'll need to adapt the project variables to your needs :

* Change the variable `smartSheetID` with the smartsheet that you want to synchronize with. Right click on the smartsheet and then properties and copy sheet id.
* Change the variable `smartSheetToken` with the token that you can generate in api access in smartsheet.
* Change the variable `sheet` with the id of the google sheet that you want to synchronize with. (the id is in the url)
